Cronjob to purge reverse proxy using HTTP PURGE


  This is a delayed reverse proxy purge that uses the static cache code introduced in 3.10
  that enables you to do delayed ( so it dosn't slow down the publishing process )
  static cleaning. So you can NOT run this cronjob thogheter with staticcache_clean.php

  You need to enable staticcache.ini [CacheSettings] CronjobCacheClear
  And site.ini [ContentSettings] StaticCache
  And then configure your reverse proxy server settings in reverse_proxy.ini
  
  
  There are som commented out lines on line 90-91 if you need more debugging in
  cronjobs/reverse_proxy_purge.php
  
  
  How to run:
  
  php runcronjobs.php reverse_proxy_purge -s eng
  
  
  Where eng is the name of your front end siteaccess.
  For more on how to run cronjobs look in the online eZ Publish doc.
