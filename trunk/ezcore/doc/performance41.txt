General Performance tips for eZ Publish 4.1


  eZ Publish 4.1 improves performance in a couple of aspects 
  and ads a couple of settings to be able to tweak performance
  without breaking BC.
  
  
  
1. eZIni check modified time tweak
  By default, eZIni will check modified time on all ini files on each
  request to determine if cache is valid or not. This is not a issue
  on Linux with ext2/3 or similar fast filesytem, but on windows, mac
  and other systems with slow stat calls (for instance nfs) this is a
  issue. Basically you'll get 40-60% overall better performance
  with this tweak on Windows, but only close to 5% on Linux. 
  
  So to disable this:
  1. Add or modify config.php in the root of your eZ Publish install.
  2a. Add the following php code in the file:
      define( 'EZP_INI_FILEMTIME_CHECK', false );
  2b. Alternatively to make the system still check for modifications
      to some specific ini file, in this case site.ini:
      define( 'EZP_INI_FILEMTIME_CHECK', 'site.ini' );


2. Translation check modified time tweak
  Just like ezini, the translation system checks modified time on
  each used translation file on each request. This tweak dosn't
  give the same improvement as the ezini tweak does. Simply
  because there is a lot more ini files then ts files on a
  typical install.
  
  To disable set this setting in site.ini:
  [RegionalSettings]
  TranslationCheckMTime=enabled
  
  
3. Skip url translation sql call on system urls
   By default the system will check for url translations
   on each request unless the url is empty (index page).
   So basically you can redirect a /content/view/full/69
   url to /content/view/full/2 if you want or something similar.
   If you don't use this feature, you might want to spare your
   database from these calls, here is how to disable it in site.ini:

   [URLTranslator]
   TranslatableSystemUrls=disabled

4. Avoid cache_ttl=0
   (This is not in svn yet as of 24.09.08)
   To read more on the issue:
   http://issues.ez.no/IssueView.php?Id=13274&activeItem=3
   Basically you can get into file lock issues if you use cache_ttl=0 on
   a slow template.
   
   To let the view cache system know about cache_ttl=0 in advance, disable it pr
   node in site.ini:
   [ContentSettings]
   ViewCacheSettings[69]=disabled
   
   Note: It is not really recommended to disable view cache for performance reasons,
   so you should rather set it cache_ttl to a low number, to make sure the data is more
   or less current and page is cached in case of increased traffic on that page.
   So at least set it to ~60 (1 min), so it's not cached for no good reason.
   
   But: You should ideally identify why you need cache_ttl to clear cache frequently,
   by investigating how the view cache system works to better take advantage of it:
   http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual/4_0/features/view_caching/clearing_the_view_cache

   If it is because you manually fetch unrelated nodes in the node template, you should
   think about using relations instead, so:
   1. it's not hardcoded, letting editor change the relation
   2. let the view cache system take care of expiring cache when relations change. 
   
   If you however for some reason fetch the current user in the code and use his name
   or id in some way, you should try to look at avoiding that.
   Alternatively you can use a new setting to set view cache to work pr user:
   (introduced in the issue/setting mentioned above)
   
   [ContentSettings]
   ViewCacheSettings[69]=pr_user

   Note: as mentioned already, this ('ViewCacheSettings') is not in svn yet, and
   might not end up in 4.1.
