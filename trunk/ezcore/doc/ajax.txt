index_ajax.php:

    A light ajax index.php for your ajax modules, checks access to siteaccess
    and module / view and gives response according to HTTP_ACCEPT header.
    Is approximately 2-4 times faster then normal index.php loading, and 
    you avoid getting a large and slow 404 response if something went wronge..
    Supported responses: xml, json and text/xhtml

    Note: ActiveAccessExtenions setting is for performance reasons disabled, you can however
    re activate it by uncommenting "eZExtension::activateExtensions('access');" at line ~149.
    
    Install:
    1. copy file from root of extension to root of eZ Publish installation.
    2. Add this to your apache rewrite rules:
       RewriteRule ezcore/.* /index_ajax.php [L]
       
    Using on your own modules:
    0. This example uses myextension and mymodule as extension and module name
    1. Add this to module.ini:
       [ModuleSettings]
       ExtensionAjaxRepositories[]=myextension
    2. Add Rewrite rule
       RewriteRule mymodule/.* /index_ajax.php [L]


ezcore/call:

    A simple to use (module) view where you register your own php classes
    or templates that should be callable to the world.
    
    Working examples on php class and template use can be found in ezcore.ini
    
    Use from javascript using the bundled ezcore js library:
      1. First load the needed javascript using the ezscript template operator:
         {ezscript(array('ez_core.js', 'ezcore::server'))}

      2a. when this is loaded you can call your server code like this:
         ez.server.call( 'ezcore::time', myCallBackFunction );

      2b. Alternatively you can call several server functions at once to save time (and requests to your server):
         ez.server.call( ['ezcore::time','ezcore::keyword'], myCallBackFunction );

      3. Create your call back function to handle the response from the server:
        function myCallBackFunction( content, errorCode, errorText )
        { 
            // errorCode is 0 if everything went ok
            alert( content + errorCode + errorText );
        }
      

ezcoreservercall.php:

    The php code that does all the code for the ezcore/call, also used by the ezpacker.php
    code (ezcss and ezscript template operators) for custom code generators (used for i18n 
    string generator in Online Editor 5.0 for tinyMCE translation integration).

ezajaxcontent.php:

    Functions for encoding mixed data to json / xml / text, and functionality for simplifying
    node(s) to a hash so they can be encoded.
    Also function for figuring out what kind of content type the client accepts to be able
    to do auto encoding based on preferred content type.
    json encoding uses the php json extension included in php 5.2 and higher or fallback 
    to a php version if not present.
    Template operators that uses this class: node_encode, xml_encode and json_encode
